# FITC 2016 Workshop

This is the source code from my **Physical Computing For Web Developers** workshop held during **FITC 2016** in Toronto (April 16th).

Each exercise builds up on the previous ones. So, exercice `06-KnockKnockBuzz` actually contains everything that was 
done during the whole workshop. If you want to catch up with the group, simply pick the current exercise and you're all set.

The `Libraries` folder contains various front-end JavaScript libraries used throughout the workshop.

Node.js modules have not been included. After downloading the sources, you can easily install all necessary Node modules by issuing `npm install` from within the project's root folder. This will install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
