# FITC 2016 Workshop

This is the source code from my **Physical Computing For Web Developers** workshop held during **FITC 2016** in Toronto (April 16th).

Each exercice builds up on the previous ones. So, exercice `06-KnockKnockBuzz` actually contains everything that was 
done during the whole workshop. If you want to catch up with the group, simply pick the current exercice and you're all set.
